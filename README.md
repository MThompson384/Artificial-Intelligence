# üß† AI & Machine Learning Applications
**Course assignments exploring machine learning models for market analysis and forecasting**

Ever wondered how AI models can predict wine quality or forecast stock market volumes? I tackled these exact challenges by utilizing cutting-edge machine learning technologies to build intelligent prediction systems for real-world applications.
Through this coursework, I developed comprehensive solutions spanning neural networks, time series forecasting, and information theory - demonstrating practical experience with the core technologies powering modern AI and machine learning.

## üéØ The Problem That Caught My Attention

While exploring machine learning applications, I discovered that modern AI faces three critical challenges:
- **Pattern Recognition:** How do you design neural networks that learn complex relationships in data?
- **Sequential Prediction:** How do you model time-dependent patterns for financial forecasting?
- **Information Theory:** How do you quantify uncertainty and decision-making in classification problems?

I thought: *"This sounds like exactly the kind of problem analytics could solve!"*
